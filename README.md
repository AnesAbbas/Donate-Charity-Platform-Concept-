# Donate-Charity-Platform-Concept-

Today we live in a world driven by platforms, there are platforms for sharing videos, for music, for shopping, for gaming, for socializing, etc. Yet, we somehow still do not have a world renowned platform for charities! So the idea is for one stop shop platform to bring together people who want to give or extend a helping hand, with organizations that can make that happen.

The biggest advantage for a platform of this sort is that it can bring more exposure to chariatable initiatives, and the most pressing causes, via a unified experience where it would be easier for people to learn about such initiatives and make better educated dicisions of which initiatives to support based on transparent metrics on the performance of the chariatble organizations and their rankings. It should also help nurture a stronger culture of chariaty via such mechanisms as gamification and reward points.
